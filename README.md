# UGAF

### Unsupervised Graph Analysis Framework
UGAF is a frameowork for analysis of a collection for graphs. This includes functionality such as:
* Cleansing and standardizing graph data.
* Creating node and structural embedding for nodes in the graph collection.
* Creating embedding for graphs (graph embedding).

### Instalation Process
UGAF uses Python 3.x (currently tested using Python 3.11).
You can install UGAF using the following:
```console
pip install git+https://${GIT_USERNAME}:${GIT_PASSWORD}@github.com/elmspace/ugaf.git
```
where `GIT_USERNAME` and `GIT_PASSWORD` are environment variables, which you can set in terminal by using:
```console
export GIT_USERNAME=<your git username>
```
and 
```console
export GIT_PASSWORD=<your git classic token>
```
** Future version of UGAF will be on public PyPi, which would allow you to install it using `pip` directly.
